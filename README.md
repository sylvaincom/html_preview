THis GitHub repository is just for me to drop some HTML files that I would like to preview online using https://html-preview.github.io/, see [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8446218/how-to-see-an-html-page-on-github-as-a-normal-rendered-html-page-to-see-preview).

Examples:
- [basic_tests/my_html.html](basic_tests/my_html.html) can be previewed online at the following link:
https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/sylvaincom/html_preview/blob/main/basic_tests/my_html.html
- [basic_tests/my_notebook.html](basic_tests/my_notebook.html) can be previewed online at the following link:
https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/sylvaincom/html_preview/blob/main/basic_tests/my_notebook.html

For some reason, an export from [`skore`](https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore)'s dashboard does not work:
- [probabl/skore/basic_usage.html](probabl/skore/basic_usage.html) can not be previwed at https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/sylvaincom/html_preview/blob/main/probabl/skore/basic_usage.html
