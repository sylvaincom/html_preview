THis GitHub repository is just for me to drop some HTML files that I would like to preview online using https://html-preview.github.io/, see [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8446218/how-to-see-an-html-page-on-github-as-a-normal-rendered-html-page-to-see-preview).

For example, `basic_tests/my_html.html` can be previewed online at the following link:
